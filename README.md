<h1>Swiggy-vs-Zomato</h1>
This is a small take on the 2 Food Delivery Giants of India - **Swiggy and Zomato**

The main reason behind this series is to help people understand more about a product they use in day-to-day life and keep my interest in product management.

As you can see, apart from a couple of features missing in each and the Pricing there isn't much difference between these two apps.

A customer who wants Food Delivery and Groceries will incline toward Swiggy. While someone who wants to Book Table along with Food Delivery will incline toward Zomato.

This tells us that the target audience for both apps is slightly different. Yet they are each other's biggest competitors as majorly these apps are used for Ordering Food.

So this brings up the Question. What are the differentiating factors that make us choose one over the other when we are only concerned with Food Delivery? Glad, You asked. Let's understand it one by one.

KEY METRICS - FOR USERS
Offers - For the same restaurant, whichever app offers the best discount and as long as the final amount is less, users usually choose the one with a better discount.
Delivery Time - Sometimes the priority for the user is the time taken for delivery. So, whichever app delivers faster wins.
Exclusive Restaurants - Not all restaurants and food outlets are there on both the Apps. Hence the user will choose the app accordingly in such a situation.
Customer Support - Users often have a fair idea of what the customer support is going to be based on past experience or word of mouth. So it's important to have a well-trained customer support staff that can resolve any situation as fast as possible.
Payment Apps / Wallet Integration - Nowadays, Payment apps offer discounts on using their payment method, so it has become crucial to have good integration with them. The app that does better wins.
App Speed and Responsiveness - Users prefer a smooth and fast app rather than one that is buggy.
Personalised Recommendations - Users feel more connected if they get personalised recommendations or notifications for the same.
This was the user's perspective. Now, Let's dive into the Key Metrics that these companies need to track at their end.
